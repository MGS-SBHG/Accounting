/*
An ordinary annuity
    a series of recurring payments made at The End of a period
            payments for quarterly stock dividends

An annuity due
    a series of recurring payments made at The Beginning of a period.
            Monthly rent payments
            monthly mortgage payments

Present value:
    how much money you would need Now
        to produce a series of payments in the future
        assuming a set interest rate

Future value
    a measure of how much a series of regular payments
        will be worth at some point in the future,
        given a set interest rate.
        If you're making regular payments on a mortgage
            calculating the future value Can Help you determine
                the total cost of the loan.

The present value of an annuity
    refers to how much money would be needed today
        to fund a series of future annuity payments
            it's the sum that must be invested Now
                to guarantee a desired payment in the future
