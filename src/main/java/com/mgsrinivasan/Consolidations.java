    Acquisition Method
	    Acquirer acquires > 50 % interest of Acquiree  net assets at FMV

    Control is permanent.
	    if temporary - Acquiree is going through Bankruptcy

    Worksheet is used
	    Acquirer consolidates w/ Acquiree all assets at FMV
        each Co. continues to run themselves;
                 separate financial accounting books
	    consolidate Net assets at FMV


 Asset Acquisition
	Co buys assets and liabilities of another Co.
	assets Will Go on books of Acquiring Co.
	NOT for Consolidation

4 Steps for Applying Acquisition Method:
1.	Id Acquirer
2.	Acquisition Date
3.	Recognize and Measure
    a.	Identifiable Assets acquired
    b.	Liabilities Assumed
    c.	Non-Controlling Interest ( formerly Minority interest) in Acquiree
4. Recognize and Measure
    Goodwill
    or
    Gain from Bargain Purchase

Consolidated F/S
1.	Control:
        Acquisition > 50% of Outstanding Voting Stock
	     Acquirer Will Control Acquiree;
	     Requires Preparing Consolidated F/S
2.	Investment account is eliminated
		Replaced by specific assets and liabilities of Acquiree Corp.

IF own > 50%, Acquirer / Acquiree Relationship
Consolidations:
    >50% of Outstanding Voting Stock,
    Control IS Permanent.

Examples of NONControl:
1.	Acquiree: legal reorganization / bankruptcy
2.	Acquiree: foriegn country has severe restrictions on financial transactions of business from material political or economic uncertainty

Investment = LT Investment in UnConsolidated Investee on Investor’s B/S
	Cost method is used
		Unless Acquirer qualifies to use
Equity Method
or	FV Option


Variable Interest Entity (VIE) and Primary Beneficiary:
 aka Special Purpose Entities
Control by contractual, ownership, or other
1.	Pecuniary Interest that changes w/ changes in Entity’s Net Asset Value

Entity w/ Controlling Financial Interest
        (Not > 50% ownership of Common Stock)
		in VIE = “Primary Beneficiary” of VIE
			req’d to consolidate VIE in Financial Statements
			guarantees the losses
			Qualitative Not Quantitative Control

        Controlling Financial Interest:
			1 Power to direct VIE’s activities that Most Significantly impact VIE’s economic performance
			2 Obligation to Absorb  VIE losses (potentially significant)
			       Right to Receive VIE benefits (potentially significant)

2.	Qualitative Approach: determines power to control
	Primary Beneficiary
        runs activities of the VIE
        guarantees the losses and debts so that
                the VIE does not go into collections
		Must Consolidate
b.	Entity: determines whether it is "Primary Beneficiary"
                on the Date it becomes involved with the VIE

Disclosures:
	Terms of Arrangements
		i.e. if VIE has massive losses,
		    Primary Beneficiary states it will absorb those losses.
	Primary Beneficiary: the Acquirer
	VIE:                 the Acquiree

IF NOT Primary Beneficiary:
	NOT required to Consolidate
Disclose:
a.	Carrying Amount and Classification of Assets and Liabilities
        relating to the interest in the VIE
b.	Max exposure to loss from VIE involvement
c.	Comparison:
        Asset and Liab carrying amount to Max Exposure to Loss;
        Supporting information explaining differences in amounts
d.	Info on:
        Liquidity;
        Guarantees;
        Other 3rd Party
e.	Significant factors considered and judgments
        in determining that
            the power to direct the activities of the VIE Is shared

No % Ownership Requirement to be a V.I.E.;
    Just Qualitative tests

Consolidated F/S:
prepared from worksheets beginning w/ trial balances of Acquirer and Acquiree
a.	Eliminating worksheet Entries
        InterCo Transactions made to reflect 2 separate Co’s results of operations;
        eliminated to 1 combined entity - The Acquirer
b.	Consolidation Process - only on the worksheet;
			NOT on the Acquirer’s or Acquiree’s financial books

Example  Pelican (Acquirer) acquires 100% of Swan (Acquiree);
NO NonControlling (Minority) Interest

I.	 JE on books of Acquirer
		Investment in Swan  			160,000
                                        (nbr of shares 16,000 x FV $10 )
			C/S (Acquirer)					16,000
			(16,000 x $1)
			APIC							144,000
			(difference)

II.	Create Worksheet of FV Amts

III. Eliminate Aquiree’s (Swans) SHE section against Investment account and InterCo transactions
 “Differential” Account - difference between BV and FV of Acquiree’s Net Assets.

		Differential-Swan	56,000
		Capital Stock		60,000
		APIC-Swan		    10,000
		RE-Swan		        34,000
			Investment in Swan		160,000

Closeout Differential Account - bring assets from BV to FV

	Goodwill	23,000
	Inventory	1,000
	Equipment	12,000
	Patents	3,000
	Client List	5,000

InterCompany Transactions and Profit

Parent / Acquirer to Sub / Acquiree:
A/R	            100,000
    InterCo. Sales	    100,000

COS	            100,000
    A/P		            100,000

On Consolidation WorkSheet:
A/P		        100,000
	A/R			        100,000

InterCo. Sales	 100,000
	COS			        100,000

Sub:	Parent to Sub:
$100,000 purchases to Sub
	GP Margin 10%

	if 20% still in EI:
		100,000 x 20% = $20,000 EI from Parent
		x GP%			10%
	Need to remove:		$2,000

On worksheet: Remove InterCo Profit:
	COS 	2,000
		E.I.	2,000
	(Profit / Markup to get Inventory to cost )

3.	Eliminate Profit: InterCo Fixed Asset Transactions
	Parent sells equipment to Sub at Gain / Loss
		need to eliminate Gain / Loss

	Restore Asset Back to Original Cost as though Sale Never Occured.

	Bring back Accum Dep. that was written off.

	When Parent sold to Sub:
		Loss
		Accum Dep.
			Fixed Asset
			Gain

		Needs to be reversed !
			Gain
			Fixed Asset
				Accum Dep.
				Loss

4. InterCo Bond Transactions:
	If Parent issued:
		B/P 	$200,000; Discount $10,000

	Sub acquired 50% of the Bonds:
Investment in Bonds $125,000

	Worksheet Eliminating Entry:
		B/P					100,000	(200,000 x 50%)
		Premium				 5,000		(10,000 x 50%)
		Loss on Extinguishment of Bonds	 20,000		(plug)
			Investment in Bonds			125,000

 */

 /*
NonControlling Interest:
Acquirer ( parent ) acquires less than 100% of sub  I.e. 90%
10% is NonControlling ( prev. Minority ) Interest

Example:
	Jan 1 yr 2. Pearl acq 90% of Sapphire by issuing
		15,000 shares of Pearl's $1.00 par; $10 FV

on Date of Acquisition:
Sapphire
had 6,000 shares outstanding C/S; $17.50 FMV
		Assets: BV = FV
			Do NOT have to write up.

JE on Pearl’s Books:
	Investment in Sapphire	$150,000			[ 15,000 x $10]
		C/S - Pearl				    $15,000	[ 15,000 x $1  ]
		APIC - Pearl 				135,000

W/S Entries:
1.	Eliminate SHE of Acquiree [ from trial balance ]:
    Differential = FV - BV

		Differential 	55,500
		C/S - Sapphire	60,000
		APIC-Sapphire	10,000
		RE-Sapphire		35,000
			Investment in Sapphire	$150,000
			NonControlling Interest	  $10,500
				[ 6,000 shares x 10% x $17.50 ]

2. Close Differential:
		Goodwill		55,000
			Differential			55,000
		[ b/c BV = FV of Net Assets ]

3. Eliminate InterCo Transactions
		Sales / Cost of Sales (COS)
		A/R  /  A/P
		InterCo Profit in EI  [ Parent ←→ Sub Sales of Inventory ]
		Gain / Loss on FIxed Assets
		InterCo Bonds
	Same as 100% Acquiistion!

Formula for Goodwill
	Acquisition Cost ( Consideration Transferred )
+	FMV-NonControlling Interest
+	FMV-Previously Held Investments in SUB
-------------------------------------------
	“Total” CV of SUB’s Net Assets
+	Increase FMV of PPE
-----------------------
	(FMV of Net Assets)
-----------------------
	Goodwill

If “Total” CV of SUB’s Net Assets > FMV of Net Assets of Sub, then it is Goodwill.


Bargain Purchase / “Negative Goodwill”:
FV of Sub’s Net Assets
+ Acquisition Cost
>
[ Consideration transfered
+ Acquisition Date FV of previously-held interest
+ FV of NonControlling Interest]

Goodwill IS NOT Amortized for Accounting purposes
Must be tested for Impairment Loss.

Example:
“Total”			160,000
FMV of Net Assets	170,000
Goodwill		10,000		charged to N.I.

Task-Based Simulation 6
On January 1, year 2,
    Arcelia Corporation acquired Gavino corporation
        by purchasing 100% of the stock of Gavino
    in exchange for
        20,000 shares of Arcelia stock.
On the date of acquisition Arcelia stock traded for $18 per share on the stock exchange.
The fair market value of Gavino’s inventory is $10,000 higher than the book value.
The book values of each company on January 1, year 2, shown below.

	                Arcelia Corp.	Gavino Corp.
Current assets	        $320,000	    $70,000
Noncurrent assets	    640,000	        380,000
Current liabilities	    210,000	        50,000
Noncurrent liabilities	150,000	        90,000
Owners’ equity	        600,000	        310,000

Calculate each of the following balance sheet amounts for Arcelia Corporation immediately following the acquisition of Gavino.

Current assets: $320,000 parent + $70,000 book value subsidiary + $10,000 inventory write-up = $400,000
Noncurrent assets: $640,000 parent + $380,000 book value subsidiary + $40,000 goodwill = $1,060,000
Total current liabilities: $210,000 parent + $50,000 subsidiary = $260,000
Noncurrent liabilities: $150,000 parent + $90,000 subsidiary = $240,000
Total owners’ equity: $600,000 parent + $360,000 new stock of parent issued in acquisition = $960,000

Elimination entries in journal entry form
a. Eliminate subsidiary equity accounts
Common stock & APIC	310,000
Differential	     50,000
Investment in Gavino		360,000

b.	To record asset write-up and goodwill. Goodwill = Acquisition cost $360,000 – FMV of net identifi able assets $320,000 ($460,000 – $140,000) = $40,000 goodwill.
Inventory	        10,000
Goodwill	        40,000
Differential	            50,000

c.	Eliminate the excess sales and costs of sales and profi ts in inventory not sold.
The intercompany sales of $50,000 must be eliminated,
along with the $50,000 in cost of sales reduced by the amount by which ending inventory
is overstated.
Ending inventory is carried on Gavino’s books at $10,000.
Ending inventory should be 20% × $30,000 cost to manufacture = $6,000.
Therefore, inventory is overstated by $4,000 and cost of sales is overstated by $46,000 ($50,000 – $4,000).

Sales	            50,000
Cost of goods sold	46,000
	Ending inventory	    4,000

d.	Eliminate intercompany receivable and payable
Accounts payable	8,000
	    Accounts receivable	8,000

e.	Eliminate sale of equipment
Gain on sale of equipment	9,000
Equipment	                36,000
	Accumulated depreciation	    45,000

f.Restore depreciation expense as if equipment had not been sold.
Normally Gavino depreciates equipment $60,000/5 years = $12,000 per year.
Equipment sold on 10/1/Y4;
therefore, Gavino recorded depreciation of 3/4 × $12,000 = $9,000.
Arcelia’s cost is $24,000 and depreciation is recorded straight-line over 3 years = $8,000 per year.
However, Arcelia depreciated equipment 3/12 months = $2,000 per year.
Total depreciation by both firms = $11,000.
Total depreciation if the asset was not sold = $12,000.
Therefore, an additional $1,000 depreciation must be recorded.

Depreciation expense	1,000
	Accumulated depreciation	1,000
