FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts (SFACs):

1. SFAC No. 8, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, Chapter 1, The Objective of General Purpose Financial Reporting
issued September 28, 2010

SFAC 8 Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting Chapter 1
The Objective of General Purpose Financial Reporting
“provide information about the reporting unit that is
useful to existing and potential
investors,
lenders,
and
other creditors
in making decisions about providing resources to the entity."

NOT All informational needs
are met by accounting or financial reporting

FOCUS: users of financial information

primary users of financial reporting
	investors
	lenders
	other creditors

mgt: internal information
other parties - regulators and the public: NOT primary users

Provide:
	1. Information Useful to Primary Users
potential and existing investors, lenders, other creditors
	2. Entity’s economic resources and claims against reporting entity
(Balance Sheet)
	3. Changes in Economic Resources (Income Statement)
	4. Financial Performance reflected by Accrual Accounting
	5. Financial Performance reflected by Past Cash Flow
( Statement of Changes in Cash Flow)
6. Changes in Economic Resources and Claims Not Resulting from Financial Performance


2. SFAC No. 8, Conceptual Framework for FInancial Reporting, Chapter 3, Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information
issued September 28, 2010

SFAC 8 Chap 3 Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Information
	hierarchy
Primary Users of Accounting Info:
	Existing and Potential Investors,
	Lenders,
	Other Creditors

Pervasive Constraint:   Benefits > Costs
		b/c  information from accounting system;
       CPA’s / Ext Auditors are expensive

				Decision Usefulness
Fundamental Qualitative Characteristics:
Relevance - capable of making a difference in a user’s decision
(a)	Predictive Value
look at past to predict what would happen in the future;
info be used to predict future outcomes
(b)	Confirmatory Value
confirms what really happened in the past;
confirms or changes how you evaluated the Co in the past
(c)	Materiality threshold
an item is material if omitting it or misstating it
could influence a user’s decision.

Faithful Representation
info depicts what it purports to represent
emphasize substance over form of the transaction
(i.e. leases - capital lease vs. operating lease)
	(a) Completeness
everything that Is Supposed To Be in the F/S IS there
presented / depicted in a way users can understand item being depicted

	(b) Neutral - absence of bias;
			info depicted w/o bias
          either favorable OR unfavorable to users
		Conservatism IS bias:
	accountant when confronted with alternative methods
of Accounting treatments,
choose the 1 that does:
NOT overstate assets
NOT overstate Earnings
Make Net Assets lower
Make NI lower

(d)	Free from Error:
No errors or omissions in information reported

Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics:
	(a) Comparability
		enable users to id and understand
similarities
   	and
differences between items.
can compare different companies
in same industry
 		    during same accounting period
			b/c companies use GAAP
		i.e. Coca-Cola vs PepsiCo

(b) Consistency
helps achieve comparability
since Co use same GAAP in different accounting periods,
helps users make comparisons across different time periods.
compare years 1,2,3 … within same company
	1 company; multiple accounting periods

(c) Verifiability
	different sources - consensus or against an amount representing an item.
		Direct method: 	direct observation
		Indirect method:	check formulas; recalculate amounts

(d) Timeliness
	information is available to the decision maker / user
when useful to make the decision.
really timely; 	    less accurate
	really accurate; less timely

(e) Understandability
	classify, characterize, present information accurately and concisely
	user has knowledge of
business and economic activities
to comprehend financial reports

Threshold for Recognition
	Materiality
effects the judgment of the user of F/S
error or omission that w/ affect the judgment of a reasonable person 	relying on the F/S
omitting / misstating could influence user’s decision
		entity specific
		related to qualitative characteristic of “Relevance”

Questions:
Neutrality is an ingredient of ?
Faithful representation
Relevance – predictive value and confirmatory value

Enhancing quality – relevance and faithful representation:
	comparability

Underlying concept that supports establishing a fixed asset impairment ?
	Faithful representation

b/c assets is less useful:
impairment loss		xxx
	accum depreciation		xxx


3. SFAC No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements
found in the outline of SFAC No. 6
Include in F/S:
	Definition of an element
	1. meet recognition criteria (i.e. revenue recognition tests)
	2. possess a relevant attribute w/c/b measured reliably (i.e. HC; historical proceeds)

Ensure that you know the definitions for:
a. Assets, Page 1117.
	probable future economic benefits
	controlled by a particular entity
	as a result of past transactions or events

	(a) characteristics
		1) probable future benefit
			by contribution to future net cash inflows
2)	entity can obtain & control access to benefit
3)	transaction or event leading to control has already occurred

	(b) continues as asset until collected; transferred; used; destroyed

	(c) valuation accounts are part of related assets
		 i.e. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts – contra-asset account to A/R

	Note: The three-part definition is
(1)	obtain it or control it today,
(2)	it will provide benefits in the future,
	and  	      (3) it occurred as a result of a past transaction.

b. Liabilities, Page 1117.
	probable future sacrifices of economic benefits
	arising from present obligations
	of a particular entity
	that result from past transactions or events

	(a) characteristics
1)	legal, equitable, or constructive duty to transfer assets in future
2)	little or no discretion to avoid future sacrifice
3)	transaction or event obligating enterprise already occurred

	(b) remains a liability until settled or discharged / liquidate it

	(c) valuation accounts are part of related reliability
		discount on B/P  contra-liab account to B/P

	Note: The three-part definition is
(1)	owe it as of today,
(2)	you will sacrifice something in the future,
		and  (3) it occurred as a result of a past transaction.

c. Equity or Net Assets, Page 1117.
	owner's residual interest in assets of an entity that remains after deducting liabilities

	A = L + SHE
	A – L  [ net assets ] = SHE	[net assets]

	(a) Business enterprises:
		characteristics of equity
			source of distributions by enterprise to its owners
			No unconditional right to receive future transfer of assets;
				depends on future profitability
			Inevitably affected by enterprise's ops and circumstances affecting enterprise
		transactions or events that change O.E.
			Revenues & expenses
			gains & losses
			investments by owners [ C/ S]
			distributions to owners [ dividends ]
			changes w/in O.E. [ stock dividends; not change total amount]

d. Revenues, Page 1118.
	Increases in assets

		Cash or A/R
			Sales

OR 	Decreases in liabilities
		Cash
			UnEarned Rev

		UnEarned Revenue
			Revenue


	during a period
	from delivering goods, rendering services, or other activities
	constituting entity's Major or Central ops

	(a) characteristics:
		accomplishments of the earnings process
		actual or expected cash inflows resulting from central ops
		inflows reported gross

e. Expenses, Page 1119.
	decreases in assets OR increases in liabilities
	during a period
	from delivering goods, rendering services, or other activities
	constituting entity's Major or Central ops

	characteristics:
		sacrifices involved in carrying out earnings process
		actual or expected cash inflows resulting from central ops
		outflows reported gross

f. Gains, Page 1119.
	increases in equity
	from peripheral transactions of entity
	excluding revenues and investment by owners

	characteristics:
		result from peripheral transactions & circumstances that may be beyond control
		may be classified according to
				Sources
			or as 	Operating or NonOperating
		change in equity reported net

g. Losses, Page 1119.
	decreases in equity
	from peripheral transactions of entity
	excluding expenses and distribution by owners

	characteristics:
		result from peripheral transactions & circumstances that may be beyond control
		may be classified according to
				Sources
			or as 	Operating or NonOperating
		change in equity reported net

h. Investments by Owners
	increases in net assets
	resulting from transfers by other entitiies
	of something of value
	to obtain ownership

 Note: Investments by owners are
				usually assets,
but could also include 	providing services to the entity
or 				conversion of the entity's liabilities.

i. Distributions to Owners, Page 1119.
	decreases in net assets
	resulting from
		transferring assets
		rendering services,
or		incurring liabilities
	by the enterprise to owners


	Distributions to owners are
				usually assets,
but could also include 	providing services to the owner
or 				conversion of the owner's liabilities.

j. Comprehensive Income, Page 1119.
	change in equity of an entity
	during period
	from transactions and other events
	of NonOwner sources
		all equity amount changes except
			investment
		and	distributions

	 Note: the SFAC definition for comprehensive income is different from the FASB ASC Topic 220 (SFAS No. 130) definition of comprehensive income.

4. Basic Assumptions:
a. Economic Entity Assumption:
	Economic activity can be identified with a particular unit of accountability.
		Note: However, you can define the entity at a higher level (e.g., Parent/Acquirer) or a lower level (e.g., Subsidiary/Acquiree).

b. Going Concern Assumption:
	The business enterprise will have a long life. The going concern assumption does not apply if liquidation of the business appears imminent. (Liquidation Accounting)
		Note: The fair value of an asset is irrelevant if we are a going concern and we need this asset in our operations; this is another reason to use historical cost instead of fair value.
PPE
– Ending Accum Dep
= Carrying Value

c. Monetary Unit Assumption:
	Money (the U.S. dollar) is the common denominator of economic activity and provides an appropriate basis for accounting measurement and analysis.
		 Note: We learn this in FC currency transaction and translation.

FC transaction
	A/P
	A/R
FC translation - convertible

d. Periodicity Assumption:
	The economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.
	We report financial information periodically to apprise users of performance and economic status.
		Note: We learned this in interim reporting (6 mos; 1 qtr).
			SEC registrant

5. Basic Principles of Accounting:

a. Historical Cost Principle:
	GAAP requires that most assets and liabilities be accounted for and reported on the basis of acquisition price because it is the most reliable valuation.
	 Note: There are exceptions (e.g., impairments for PPE, lower-of-cost-or-market for inventory).

b. Revenue Recognition Principle:
	Revenue is generally recognized when (1) realized or realizable and (2) earned.
		Revenues are realizable:  when assets received or held are readily convertible into cash or claims to cash.
		Revenues are considered earned when the entity has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues.
		Recognition at the time of sale provides a reasonable test.
			Exceptions to this rule are
(1)	recognition during production (e.g.,MOD 10 percentage of completion accounting for construction) and
(2)	recognition upon receipt of cash ( MOD 9a installment sales method or cost-recovery method of accounting);
(3)	multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and
(4)	 milestone method of recognition on research and development contracts.

c. Matching Principle:
	Expenses are to be matched to the revenues whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so.

d. Full Disclosure Principle:
	Accountants use their judgment in deciding what gets reported on the financial statements.
	If something does not appear on the statements, then it may appear in the footnotes or in supplementary information.
		The footnotes generally amplify or explain the items in the main body of the statements.
		Note: Segment reporting is a good example of footnote disclosure.
			SEC registrant / public co
	Supplementary information contains other information that may be highly relevant, but less reliable.
	i.e. Constant Dollar

6. Constraints:
a. Cost-Benefit Relationship:
	Information is expensive. The costs of providing the information must not out-weigh the benefits that can be derived from using the information.

b. Materiality:
	An item is material if its inclusion or omission would influence or change the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the FS.

c. Conservatism:
	When in doubt, choose the solution that will be least likely to overstate assets and income.  Form of bias.

7. FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). An outline of the ASC is found on Pages 62--63 of your textbook; you should familiarize yourself with it. Under the Broad Transactions listed on Page 63, the outline is missing Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements.
	Also, please note that under Industry on Page 63, which is listed generally as Topics 905 through 995,
		Topic 958 is for Not-for-Profit Entities (discussed in Module 22).

The ASC incorporated the old GAAP Hierarchy. See Page 1114 of your textbook, SFAS 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

8. The Accounting Cycle in 10 Steps.
Here is a short version of the accounting cycle:
TRANSACTION JEs (steps 1 through 3)
1. Prepare transaction Journal Entries (JEs); record them in the Journal.
2. Post transaction JEs to the General Ledger.
3. Prepare an UNADJUSTED Trial Balance.


ADJUSTING JEs (steps 4 through 6),
4. Prepare adjusting JEs; record them in the Journal.
(a) Accrual-type adjusting JEs:
	(1) Adjusting JE first (adjusting JEs do not dr. or cr. cash)
	(2) Cash JE second
	Examples:
		Accounts receivable,
		other types of receivables,
		salaries & wages payable,
		accounts payable,
		other types of payables

(b) Deferral-type adjusting JEs:
	(1) Cash JE first
	(2) Adjusting JE second (adjusting JEs do not dr. or cr. cash)
	Examples: Depreciation, prepaid expenses, unearned revenue
5. Post adjusting JEs to the General Ledger.
6. Prepare an ADJUSTED Trial Balance.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (step 7)
7. Prepare the Financial Statements and Footnotes under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Remember that footnotes are an integral part of the financial statements:
(a) Income Statement (maybe even a Statement of Retained Earnings and a Statement of Comprehensive Income);
(b) Statement of Changes in SHE;
(c) Balance Sheet; and
(d) Statement of Cash Flows.


CLOSING JEs (steps 8 through 10).
8. Prepare the CLOSING JEs; record them in the Journal.
9. Post closing JEs to the General Ledger.
10. Prepare a POST-CLOSING Trial Balance.
-- Optional: Prepare Reversing JEs, record them in the Journal and post them to the General Ledger.

You can see that I broke up the 10-step accounting cycle according to
	TRANSACTION JEs (steps 1 through 3),
	ADJUSTING JEs (steps 4 through 6),
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (step 7), and
	CLOSING JEs (steps 8 through 10).

4. Cash to Accrual
Many smaller companies use the cash basis of accounting:
revenues recorded: when cash is received
expenses recorded: when cash is paid
Except for purchases of fixed assets
capitalized and depreciated
Often the accountant is called upon to
convert cash basis accounting records
to      accrual basis.

When making journal entries to adjust
 	from the cash basis
    to the accrual basis
important: identify 2 types of amounts:
(1) The current balance in the given account (cash basis)
 	(2) The correct balance in the account 	(accrual basis).

    FAR Mod 9a Installment Sales / Cost Recovery Method / Franchise / RealEstate

Installment Sales
a. Revenue recognized as cash is collected
at the point of cash collection
rather than
the point of sale.
Installment sales accounting only be used where
“collection of the sale price Is Not Reasonably Assured”
ASC Topic 605; APB 10

b. Under the installment sales method,
gross profit is
deferred to future periods
and
recognized proportionately to collection of the receivables.
Installment receivables and deferred gross profit accounts
must be kept separate by year,
because the gross profit rate usually varies from year to year.

Assume sale is complete: If know collectability:
	A/R
		Allowance for Uncollectible/Doubtful Accounts

bad debt provision
Bad Debt Expense
	Allowance for Uncollectible/Doubtful Accounts

If Don't know collectability:
	Ie. Recognize Revenue when cash is collected
If  can't
	Est. receivable collectability
	Set up bad debt allowance

construction equipment
$1,800,000 sales price
$1,200,000 carrying amount

Drew
paid $300,000 cash on December 31, year 1,
signed a $1,500,000 note bearing interest at 10%
payable in 5 annual installments of $300,000

Mill appropriately accounts for the sale under the installment method.

On December 31, year 2
Drew paid $300,000 principal
      $150,000 interest

For the year ended December 31, year 2,
what total amount of revenue should Mill recognize
from the construction equipment sale and financing?

Example
For financial statement purposes, the installment method of accounting may be used if the
Ultimate amount collectible is indeterminate.
[ for both installment method; cost recovery method ]
Not: Percentage-of-completion method is inappropriate.
Not: Collection period extends over more than twelve months.
Not: Installments are due in different years.


Example:
According to the installment method of accounting, gross profit on an installment sale is recognized in income
In proportion to the cash collection.
Not: After cash collections equal to the cost of sales have been received.
Not: On the date of sale.
Not: On the date the final cash collection is received.


Example:
It is proper to recognize revenue Prior To the sale of merchandise when
I.	Revenue W/B Reported as an installment sale. 		NO as cash is collected
II.	Revenue W/B Reported under the cost recovery method. 	NO after recover All costs
Neither I Nor II







Franchise Agreements ASC 952

ASC Topic 952 (SFAS 45) provides that
the initial franchise fee
be recognized as revenue
by the franchiser
Only Upon substantial performance
of their initial service obligation

The amount and timing of revenue recognized depends upon:
whether the contract contains
bargain purchase agreements,
tangible property,
whether the continuing franchise fees are reasonable
in relation to future service obligations.

Direct franchise costs:
deferred until the related revenue is recognized

Franchisor 	i.e. McDonalds
Franchisee	i.e. Co buyer

Franchisor reqs down payment fee:
	If “No future svcs reqd” to earn that
down payment     IS earned as revenue
		Earnings Process IS complete

initial franchise fee
	Recognized as revenue by franchisor
Only Upon *substantial performance* of initial service obligation

B. Amount and timing of revenue recognized
	Depends on whether contract has:
		BPO - bargain purchase option
		Tangible property
		Continuing franchise fees are reasonable

C. Franchisor received down payment
and
    no future services are reqd to recognize as revenue
	If Franchisee owes money in the form of a note payable
		And future services are reqd of franchisor to earn the remaining amount
			remaining amount IS Unearned revenue.
	No earned revenue until earnings process IS complete for that part of the contract.

Example:
On December 31, year 1
Franchiser Rice, Inc.
authorized
Graf to operate as a franchisee for
an initial franchise fee of $150,000.
 		Of this amount,
$60,000 was received upon signing the agreement
the balance [$90,000]
represented by a note
due in three annual payments of $30,000 each
beginning December 31, year 2
The present value on December 31, year 1
of the three annual payments appropriately discounted is $72,000.

According to the agreement,
the nonrefundable down payment represents a fair measure of
the services already performed by Rice

	$150,000 revenue b/c earnings process IS substantially complete!

However, substantial future services Are Required of Rice.
Collectibility of the note is reasonably certain.

In Rice’s December 31, year 1 balance sheet, unearned franchise fees from Graf’s franchise S/B Reported as $ 72,000

Real Estate Transactions

Accounting treatment for real estate sales
provided by ASC Topics 360 and 976 (SFAS 66).
Due to the variety of methods of financing real estate transactions,
determining
when the risks and rewards of ownership H/B clearly transferred
and
when revenue S/B Recognized becomes very complex.

Profit from real estate sales M/B Recognized In Full
provided the profit is determinable
and 	   the earnings process is virtually complete.

The Following four criteria Must Be Met to recognize profit in full at the point of sale:
 	(1) A sale is consummated.
(2) The buyer’s initial and continuing investments
are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property.
 	(3) The seller’s receivable Is Not subject to future subordination.
(4)	The seller has transferred to the buyer
the usual risks and rewards of ownership in a transaction
in substance, a sale and Does Not have a substantial continuing involvement in the property

Depending on which combination of criteria is met,
the real estate sales will be recorded using one of the following methods:
(1) Deposit
 	(2) Cost recovery
 		(3) Installment
 		(4) Reduced profit
 		(5) Percentage-of-completion
 		(6) Full accrual

NOT record revenue until earnings process IS complete !
IF anything is req'd by seller, NOT recognize revenue

In accordance with the deposit method
payments received are recorded as a liability
until the contract is canceled
 or a sale is achieved.



Under the reduced profit method,
the seller recognizes
a portion of profit at the time of sale
with the remaining portion recognized in future periods.

Profit recognized at the time of sale
determined by
calculating the present value of the buyer’s receivable
     and applying a formula.

The reduced profit recognized at the time of sale
 	the gross profit
less
the present value of the receivable

The remaining profit is recognized in future periods.
SFAS 66

Example:
In which of the following examples of real estate transactions would the seller Not transfer the usual risks and rewards of ownership?
	I Buyer can compel seller to repurchase property
	II Seller guarantees return of buyer's investment
	III Seller is req'd to support ops of buyer and will be reimbursed on a cost plus 5% basis
		[ Sale: risk and rewards Are transferred. Seller is acting like a contractor]
a. I
b. II
c. III
d. I and II [ buyer can give back the property]











Cost Recovery method
gross profit on the sale IS Deferred
	similar to the installment sales method
No Profit IS Recognized
 	until the cumulative receipts
Exceed the cost of the asset sold.
	i.e. Recover all of COGS

EXAMPLE
In our installment sales example,
the entire profIt from year one sales ($75,000)
W/B recognized in year three.
Profit on year three sales W/B recognized in year four
to the extent that in year four
cash collections on year three sales exceed the $60,000 ($160,000 cost – $100,000 cash collected)
unrecovered cost on year three sales.

interest revenue Was To Be Earned by the seller [ sale on credit ],
Be Deferred until the entire cost was recovered.

The cost recovery method
used when the uncertainty of collection Is So Great that
even use of the installment method is precluded.

 a calendar-year sole proprietorship,
  which maintained its books on the cash basis during the year.

Baron has developed plans to expand into the wholesale fl ower market and is in the process of negotiating a bank loan to fi nance the expansion. The bank is requesting year 2 fi nancial statements prepared on the accrual basis of accounting from Baron.
During the course of a review engagement, Muir, Baron’s accountant, obtained the following additional information.
1.	Amounts due from customers totaled $32,000 at December 31, year 2.
2.	An analysis of the above receivables revealed that an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $3,800 should be provided.
3.	Unpaid invoices for fl ower purchases totaled $30,500 and $17,000, at December 31, year 2, and December 31, year 1, respectively.
4.	The inventory totaled $72,800 based on a physical count of the goods at December 31, year 2. The inventory was priced at cost, which approximates market value.
5.	On May 1, year 2, Baron paid $8,700 to renew its comprehensive insurance coverage for one year. The premium on the previous policy, which expired on April 30, year 2, was $7,800.
6.	On January 2, year 2, Baron entered into a twenty-fi ve-year operating lease for the vacant lot adjacent to Baron’s retail store for use as a parking lot. As agreed in the lease, Baron paved and fenced in the lot at a cost of $45,000. The improvements were completed on April 1, year 2, and have an estimated useful life of fi fteen years. No provision for depreciation or amortization has been recorded. Depreciation on furniture and fi xtures was $12,000 for year 2.

7.	Accrued expenses at December 31, year 1 and year 2, were as follows:

	                Year 1	Year 2
	Utilities	    $ 900	$1,500
	Payroll taxes	1,100	 1,600
	                $2,000	$3,100

8.	Baron is being sued for $400,000. The coverage under the comprehensive insurance policy is limited to $250,000. Baron’s attorney believes that an unfavorable outcome is probable and that a reasonable estimate of the settlement is $300,000.
9.	The salaries account includes $4,000 per month paid to the proprietor. Baron also receives $250 per week for living expenses.

    Kent has $500,000 in equipment and machinery that was acquired on January 2, year 1.
    Kent has been using the double-declining balance method
        to depreciate the equipment
            over an estimated 10-year economic life
            with no salvage.
   On January 1, year 3,
        Kent decides to change to
            the straight-line method
            with no salvage.
   Kent has a 40% tax rate.
   Calculate the following amounts:
	1. 	Accumulated depreciation as of 12/31/Y2	$180,000
	2. 	Depreciation expense for year 3	$ 40,000
	3. 	Accumulated depreciation as of 12/31/Y3	$220,000
	4. 	Indicate the amount of the accounting change shown net of tax if appropriate $0

Explanations
1. Before change,
Kent used double-declining balance and 10-year life
Year 1	1/10 × 2 × $500,000 book value =        $100,000 depreciation expense
Year 2	1/10 × 2 × $400,000 new book value	=   $ 80,000 depreciation expense
            Accumulated depreciation 12/31/Y1	$180,000

2.	To calculate depreciation expense for year 3:
    Historical cost 	    $500,000
    – Accum. depreciation	(180,000)
                Book value	$320,000
    $320,000 BV – $0 salvage
    ÷ 8 years remaining life
    -----------------------------
    $40,000 depreciation expense

3.	To calculate accumulated depreciation as of 12/31/Y3:
Year 1	                $100,000
Year 2	                  80,000
Year 3	                  40,000
Accum. depr. 12/31/Y3	$220,000

4.	Accounting change net of tax – zero.
Accounting standards treat changes in depreciation method
    as a change in estimate effected by a change in method.
    Therefore, a change in depreciation is accounted for on a prospective basis.

1.	Component of relevance.
1.	SFAC 5 states that “Relevance is a primary qualitative characteristic.
        To be relevant, information about an item must have feedback value or predictive value (or both)
            for users and must be timely.”

2.	Increases in net assets from incidental or peripheral transactions affect ing an entity.
2.	(G) SFAC 6 states that “Gains are increases in equity (net assets) from peripheral or incidental transactions of an entity and from all other transactions and other events and circumstances affecting the entity except those that result from revenues or investments by owners.”

10.	A performance measure concerned primarily with cash-to cash cycles.
10.	(I) SFAC 5 states that “Earnings is a measure of performance during a period that is concerned primarily with the extent to which asset infl ows associated with cash-to-cash cycles substantially completed (or completed) during the period exceed (or are less than) asset outfl ows associated, directly or indirectly, with the same cycles.”
