FASB INTERPRETATION NO.35
CRITERIA FOR APPLYING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK.
Interprets APB 18.
Investors Owning Between 20 and 50% of an investee:
        May Not Be Able to * exercise significant influence *
            over the investee’s operating and financial policies.
The presumption of * significant influence * stands until overcome by
evidence to the contrary i.e.:
(1) opposition by the investee
(2) agreements under which the investor surrenders shareholder rights,
(3) majority ownership by a small group of shareholders,
(4) inability to obtain desired information from the investee,
(5) inability to obtain representation on investee board of directors,
etc.

Whether contrary evidence Is Sufficient to negate the presumption of significant influence
        a matter of judgment
            requiring a careful evaluation of ALL pertinent facts and circumstances,
                some cases over an extended period of time

Application of this interpretation resulting in changes to or from The Equity Method
    S/B Treated per APB 18, paras 19l and 19m.
